A curated list of not properly fixed apple security bugs and attempts to influence disclosure

This list will be filled over the next weeks with instances that we know of.

We will create a table showing for every iOS/MacOS/OSX version of the last 5-6 years what vulnerabilities they were vulnerable to that had been previously disclosed/patched and that were not patched correctly.

However we would love to hear from you what instances you know of (with sources) that should be added to the list.
You can either do this in public via GitHub or send a private e-mail to badbadapple@antid0te.com .
